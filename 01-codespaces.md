# Setting Up GitHub Codespaces for the AI Workshop

## What is GitHub Codespaces?
GitHub Codespaces is a cloud development environment that allows you to code directly in your browser without any local setup. For this workshop, we'll use Codespaces to ensure everyone has the same development environment with all necessary dependencies pre-installed.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account (create one at [github.com](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have one)
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)

## Accessing GitHub Codespaces
- Manage your codespaces: [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
- Codespaces settings: [https://github.com/settings/codespaces](https://github.com/settings/codespaces)

## Using Codespaces for this Workshop

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Go to the workshop repository URL (provided by your instructor)
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner
3. Follow the prompts to create your own copy of the repository

### Step 2: Launch a Codespace
1. Navigate to your forked repository
2. Click on the green "Code" button
3. Select the "Codespaces" tab
4. Click "Create codespace on main"

### Step 3: Wait for Setup to Complete
- The system will automatically configure your Python environment and install dependencies
- This may take a few minutes

### Step 4: Verify Your Environment
Once your Codespace loads, you should see:
- VS Code running in your browser
- A terminal available (accessible via Terminal > New Terminal)
- Python 3.10+ installed
- Required dependencies installed

### Using Your Codespace
- All changes are automatically saved
- The environment comes with Python and necessary libraries pre-installed
- You can commit and push changes directly from the Codespace
- Your work will persist between sessions
- You can access your Codespace's web applications via the "Ports" tab

### Free Tier Limits
- GitHub provides 60 hours of free Codespaces usage per month
- Your Codespace will automatically stop after 30 minutes of inactivity to save your quota
- You can always restart it where you left off
